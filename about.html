<h2>Here is a short summary of my work and what i want to acomplish:</h2>
<h3> I'm currently going to college for Pyhsical Therapy which i am not very happy with, and so here begins my journey
    as a Web Developer! I don't intend on giving up because i find Web Developing very interesting and fun!
    I can see my self doing this full time in the future when i get a good and a stable job.
    I really love the idea of working from the comfort of my home and enjoying work, Web developemnt does have
    upsides and downsides but i like challanges that make my brain really work!</h3>

    <h3> So here we go with my Adventure!</h3>
